# This project will be home to my work on Leetcode Questions, each question will live in its own directory.

## The format for the directory should follow the rules
1. Start with the question number (This should make them easier to find in the future)
2. Include the short question name
3. Each question directory should include a readme.md file of their own; which includes that question that was asked of the developer, including a link to the actual questions on leetcode
4. Within each question directory the subdirectory should the language plus version (dotnet9, java8, python3)
5. Each Language plus version directory should include a read me and instructions on how to execute the question on the terminal
6. Each attempt should be documented and not stored within GIT, add one more folder that houses a specific attempt

```
/leetcode/138 - random question/dotnet/attempt1/*** Executable ***
